Installation is very easy (due mostly to a lack of major overhauls with things),
all you really need to do is make a new folder at the same level of hierarchy as
the base Quake 4 game and add def files.

The mod is supposed to just make Q4 into a turn-based role-playing game, along the
lines of the Pokemon or Mario & Luigi series. Enemies give experience and cash upon
defeat, which in turn is used to level up and buy items from shopkeeps, respectively
(at least they were intended to).

Rather than you getting weapons the normal way (aka randomly throughout the game), you
now get weapons based on your level, and you can purchase things like med-packs and ammo
from the shopkeeper NPCs that can be found throughout levels (neither of these happened).
